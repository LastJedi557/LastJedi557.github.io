            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Hello! I'm Abdullah Al-Ani, a sophomore at Troy High School in Michigan. Originally from Dundas, Hamilton, Canada, I moved to Windsor at the age of 6 before settling in Troy. I am passionate about Taekwondo, holding a first-degree black belt and boasting numerous championships, including being a 3-time TMA Grand Champion and reigning Meijer State Champion. Outside of martial arts, I excel academically and graduated with honors from UCMAS, holding a world record for completing the International Standard of UCMAS Abacus Mental Arithmetic Proficiency Examination Grade 10 Distinction with 100% accuracy.</p>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Abdullah Al-Ani">
                <p>Aside from my academic and athletic pursuits, I am deeply involved in my community. As a devout Muslim, I spend time at the Mosque and have volunteered at Children Centers and Animal Rescue Initiatives. I am also a member of Model UN at Troy High School and have a love for soccer.</p>
                <p>I have a curious mind and enjoy exploring various fields of knowledge. From philosophy to computer science, I find joy in learning and expanding my horizons. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching documentaries, and engaging in stimulating discussions with friends and family.</p>
